AGI Jobs

A clean AI Jobboard

Use KVDB

User can:
- See all jobs as a table (use the list keys command `curl https://kvdb.io/N7cmQg1DwZbADh2Hu3NncF/     -u 'jobs:'`, then get each resource one by one)
- Upload resource (using post to kvdb), triggering a modal that can be filled

Each resource has a title, description, and URL

Show a picture from https://source.unsplash.com/random/?portrait%20professional on the modal for the job

Anyone can edit or delete a resource
